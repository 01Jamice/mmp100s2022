	<h1>Chase is more keen on Columbia as she has already taken classes there during her undergrad</h1>
	<p>Chase has her friends that live in New York City that can help show her around</p>
	<p>She would also be able to be closer to her family and would be able to visit more frequently during her studies</p>
	<p>There would also be faster job oppertunities in the city once she finishes grad school and further her career</p>
